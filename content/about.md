Hello, and welcome to my website!

My name is Keenan, and I'm a recent Colorado School of Mines alum (B.S. in
Computer Science with a focus in Computer Engineering, 2024) living in Edmonds,
Washington. I am a former Software Engineer Intern at
[ICR, Inc.](https://www.icr-team.com/) and an incoming student at the
University of Washington (M.S. in Information Management with a focus in
Program/Product Management & Consulting, 2025). Previously, I worked at
[Datava](https://datava.com/).

My technical interests include:
- computer science & engineering
- full-stack development
- programming
- technical product management
- consulting

My non-technical interests include:
- music
- photography
- sports

When I'm not working or at school, I enjoy skiing, backpacking, and, in
general, being outdoors. I'll often take either a DSLR or film camera
on these excursions, and I share my work on my [blog](/). I post about
my travels, technology, education, projects, and anything else that might
come to mind. On my [portfolio][1] page, I have an up-to-date overview
of my professional achievements as well as my up-to-date
[resume](/portfolio/resume.pdf). If you find my work intriguing and
believe I could be a valuable addition to your team, please don't hesitate
to reach out - I am currently seeking new opportunities! You can find
links to all of my public-facing social media accounts in the footer of
this site.

Thanks for stopping by!
