Hello, and welcome to my website!

My name is Keenan, and I'm a recent Colorado School of Mines alum (B.S. in
Computer Science with a focus in Computer Engineering, 2024) living in Golden,
Colorado. I am a Software Engineer Intern at
[ICR, Inc.](https://www.icr-team.com/) and an incoming student at the
University of Washington (M.S. in Information Management with a focus in
Program/Product Management & Consulting, 2025). Previously, I worked at
[Datava](https://datava.com/).

I'm passionate about:
- Programming
- Computer Science & Engineering
- Software Architecture & Engineering
- Photography
- Sports Analytics

When I'm not working or at school, I enjoy skiing, backpacking, and, in
general, being outdoors. I'll often take either a DSLR or film camera
on these excursions, and I share my work on my [blog](/). I post about
my travels, technology, education, projects, and anything else that might
come to mind. On my [portfolio][1] page, I have an up-to-date overview
of my professional achievements as well as my up-to-date resume. You can
find links to all of my public-facing social media accounts that I
regularly use in the footer of this site.

Thanks for stopping by!
