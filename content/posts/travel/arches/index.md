  These are my thoughts and reflections on my exploration of Arches National Park.

Wow, time really does fly. I feel like I'm only now finding my bearings since my previous post about [Mount Lincoln](https://keenanschott.com/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/) - I have since moved from [home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whidbey_Island) to [Edmonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds,_Washington) to (at some point in the near future) Seattle, visited two national parks, and ventured out of North America for the first time to see the sights in Iceland. As soon as I have the opportunity to organize all my photos, I'll be sure to expand on this post and create future posts on [Mount Rainier](https://keenanschott.com/posts/travel/mount-rainier/) and the scenes around [Reykjav√≠k](https://keenanschott.com/posts/travel/iceland/). In the mean time, in the name of staying on a schedule, I thought I'd post this update.

My father and I stopped by [Arches National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arches_National_Park) for a few days on our way home from Colorado in August. The following photos are some of the highlights that I managed to capture when I wasn't struggling in the scorching temperatures. It was an amazing stop to not only enjoy some incredible scenes, but to give greater purpose to what would have otherwise been a monotonous journey. Unlike my last post on Mt. Lincoln, I won't provide further commentary on each photo. I hope you enjoy these photos as much as I enjoyed my time in Arches - cheers!
