  These are my ten favorite albums from 2024.
---

In 2023, I embarked on a personal journey of listening to an album every single day. This endeavor expanded my musical horizons, but unfortunately, it went largely unchronicled and remains unshared with the world. Now, as a step toward sharing the music that shaped my year time around, I am excited to present ten albums that truly defined my 2024.

Please note that this list includes only albums released in the past year. Some honorable mentions are [*BRAT*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_(album)) by [Charli XCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX), [*Fine Art*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Art_(Kneecap_album)) by [KNEECAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_(band)), [*Samurai*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_(Lupe_Fiasco_album)) by [Lupe Fiasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupe_Fiasco), [*Alligator Bites Never Heal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_Bites_Never_Heal) by [Doechii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doechii), [*This is How Tomorrow Moves*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_How_Tomorrow_Moves) by [beabadoobee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beabadoobee), [*Bright Future*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_Future_(Adrianne_Lenker_album)) by [Adrianne Lenker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrianne_Lenker), [*I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Lay_Down_My_Life_for_You) by [JPEGMAFIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEGMafia), [*In Waves*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Waves_(Jamie_xx_album)) by [Jamie xx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_xx), [*Two Star & The Dream Police*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Star_%26_the_Dream_Police) by [Mk.gee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk.gee), and [*Cold Visions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Visions) by [Bladee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladee), among others.

      In <i>Three</i>, Four Tet departs from his typical stadium setlists and navigates a far more intimate, restrained tone. An album built for getting lost in the soundscape and locking in; a far cry from his work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skrillex" target="_blank">Skrillex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Again" target="_blank">Fred again..</a>.

      A pairing of vivacious, energetic sound and a downcast, nostalgic mood, creating an album that pulls listeners between joy and melancholy. Although I still prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurture_(album)" target="_blank">Nurture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_(Porter_Robinson_album)" target="_blank">Worlds</a> over <i>SMILE! :D</i>, the tour for this album was an incredible show and perhaps one of the best concert experiences I've had the fortune of seeing.

      It would be wrong to exclude the GOAT of West Coast hip-hop from this list. I spent this year exploring Kendrick's earlier work, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section.80" target="_blank">Section.80</a>, and I was impressed by how well it holds up and will continue to hold up twenty years from now. GNX is no different. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SZA" target="_blank">SZA</a> features showcase his talent across genres. This album got mustard.

      I've been a fan of Parannoul since the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_See_the_Next_Part_of_the_Dream" target="_blank">To See the Next Part of the Dream</a>, an album completed alone and in a bedroom. The vocals were recorded on a Samsung Galaxy S5. Sky Hundred continues this legacy of noisy, swelling shoegaze. I was overjoyed to see this release considering I was not a fan of the <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fax-gang-parannoul-scattersun/" target="_blank">collaboration album</a> earlier this year with <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/fax-gang-aethernet-interview" target="_blank">Fax Gang</a>.

      The Marías' combination of psych, jazz, and dream-pop creates a melancholic album that, with the added context of the <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a60949592/the-marias-breakup-submarine-interview/" target="_blank">breakup</a> between the couple that founded the band, resonates deeply with themes of love, loss, and introspection. It's hard to hate.

      Building on her signature dreamy indie-pop sound, Clairo continues to draw upon the '70s palette as she did in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(album)" target="_blank">Sling</a>, another fantastic album. It's interesting to read about her <a href="      https://www.vulture.com/article/clairo-charm-influences.html" target="_blank">inspirations</a> for this album, which include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Nilsson" target="_blank">Harry Nilsson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys" target="_blank">The Beach Boys</a>.

      As sad as I was to see the split of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Midi" target="_blank">black midi</a>, <i>The New Sound </i>does not disappoint. His unsubtle, unsympathetic characters paired with an unrelenting slurry of salsa, showtunes, jazz, and samba, among dozens of other styles, make for an album that some consider exhausting. If you can stomach the rollercoaster, it really is compelling.

      HYUKOH and Sunset Rollercoaster join forces to create an album that's true to their beloved sounds, yet never cancels each other out. We get psych, bossa-nova, indie-pop, and more, with and the list going on and on for each track. And this is from two bands from different countries. Yet it's cohesive, and well-paced, with every instrument and voice adding depth and texture. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDLN4LWPIXw&list=PL2byhjvwcjEcbEhFn5MiCE1u-HzYAc-6P&index=2" target="_blank">Y</a> is one of my favorite songs of the year.

      On their fourth album, the Irish group trades steely post-punk for stadium-sized alt rock. I've been enamored with the group since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinty_Fia" target="_blank">Skinty Fia</a>, and although I expected a similar sound on <i>Romance</i>, I can't say I'm disappointed. I enjoy their newfounded amalgamation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop" target="_blank">Britpop</a> and '90s alt rock. My favorite tracks include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWsF-gFGGlo" target="_blank">In the Modern World</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtEFQLB7Vds" target="_blank">Bug</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtEFQLB7Vds" target="_blank">Favourite</a>.

      As my introduction to Magdalena Bay, <i>Imaginal Disk</i> quickly became my favorite pop album of the year and served as a stellar first impression to the duo. The almost kitschy sci-fi theme working in tandem with candy floss melodies, as exemplified in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8gfVTnbBi8" target="_blank">Death & Romance</a>, craft what would be mindless pop if done by any other artist. The album takes my favorite pieces from each of the band's primary inspirations: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimes" target="_blank">Grimes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairlift_(band)" target="_blank">Chairlift</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX" target="_blank">Charli XCX</a>.

I might look back on these rankings in a month's time and wonder what I was thinking. Regardless, this is how it all fell into place for me right now, and I think it's fascinating that, with the passing of time, we can look back on art and feel drastically different about it. Anyway, I'm excited to see what 2025 has to offer.
