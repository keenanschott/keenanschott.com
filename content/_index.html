        <b>Introduction to Computer Science Lab (CSCI 102)</b> in Spring 2022, Fall 2022, and Spring 2023.

        I became a TA for CSCI 102 while I was still a first-year student, directly after taking the
        course myself. In this role, I worked under Eric Roels and Dr. Rob Thompson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Topics that the class covered: Python programming, which included data types, functions, recursion,
        etc., the translation between word problems, algorithms, and high-level computer programs,
        debugging, synthesis of documentation and online resources, and complex program design.

      </p>
      <p>
        Topics that the class covers: Python basics, algorithms, data representation, conditionals and
        boolean logic, scientific computing best practices, loops, complex logic, files, data science,
        social concerns, functions, and classes and objects.

    <p>
      As robots are deployed into large-scale human environments, they will need to
      engage in task-oriented dialogues about objects and locations beyond those
      that can currently be seen. In these contexts, speakers use a wide range of
      referring gestures beyond those used in the small-scale interaction contexts
      that HRI research typically investigates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this work, we thus seek to understand how robots can better generate
      gestures to accompany their referring language in large-scale interaction
      contexts. In service of this goal, we present the results of two
      human-subject studies: (1) a human-human study exploring how human gestures
      change in large-scale interaction contexts, and to identify human-like gestures
      suitable to such contexts yet readily implemented on robot hardware; and (2) a
      human-robot study conducted in a tightly controlled Virtual Reality environment,
      to evaluate robots' use of those identified gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our results show that robot use of Precise Deictic and Abstract Pointing
      gestures afford different types of benefits when used to refer to visible vs.
      non-visible referents, leading us to formulate three concrete design guidelines.
      These results highlight both the opportunities for robot use of more humanlike
      gestures in large-scale interaction contexts, as well as the need for future
      work exploring their use as part of multi-modal communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a research assistant, I aided in leading the human-robot study and analyzing
      the results. I utilized R to draw conclusions from experimental data, and our
      work was presented by my colleague, Annie Huang, at the 2024 ACM/IEEE
      International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction
      (<a href="https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2024/" target="_blank">HRI 2024</a>)

      <a href="https://cs-courses.mines.edu/csci306/index.html" target="_blank">CSCI 306</a>
      (Software Engineering) course. This project was a great introduction to building larger, cohesive pieces of
      software; I utilized unit testing and employed advanced object-oriented programming
      (OOP) techniques in Java.

      Singular Value Decomposition Image Compression was designed as an investigation into a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition" target="_blank">concept</a>
      I had recently learned about in my linear algebra class. I utilized Python to display the
      original image, the compressed image, the compression ratio, and the conserved data.

      I gave a presentation on this paper at the end of CSCI 474 (Introduction to
      Cryptography) on the use of Homomorphic Encryption (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption"
      target="_blank">HE</a>) and Secure Multi-Party Computation
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation" target="_blank">SMPC</a>) in financial
      markets to strengthen the balance
      between market integrity and market transparency.
