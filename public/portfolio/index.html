engage in task-oriented dialogues about objects and locations beyond those
that can currently be seen. In these contexts, speakers use a wide range of
referring gestures beyond those used in the small-scale interaction contexts
that HRI research typically investigates.</p><p>In this work, we thus seek to understand how robots can better generate
gestures to accompany their referring language in large-scale interaction
contexts. In service of this goal, we present the results of two
human-subject studies: (1) a human-human study exploring how human gestures
change in large-scale interaction contexts, and to identify human-like gestures
suitable to such contexts yet readily implemented on robot hardware; and (2) a
human-robot study conducted in a tightly controlled Virtual Reality environment,
to evaluate robots' use of those identified gestures.</p><p>Our results show that robot use of Precise Deictic and Abstract Pointing
gestures afford different types of benefits when used to refer to visible vs.
non-visible referents, leading us to formulate three concrete design guidelines.
These results highlight both the opportunities for robot use of more humanlike
gestures in large-scale interaction contexts, as well as the need for future
work exploring their use as part of multi-modal communication.</p><p>As a research assistant, I aided in leading the human-robot study and analyzing
the results. I utilized
<a href=https://www.r-project.org/ target=_blank>R</a>
to draw conclusions from experimental data, and our
work was presented by my colleague, Annie Huang, at the 2024 ACM/IEEE
International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2024) in Boulder, Colorado.</p></div></details><h2 id=projects>Projects
