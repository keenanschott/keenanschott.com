As soon as I have the opportunity to organize all my photos, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to expand on this post and create future posts on Mount Rainier and the scenes around ReykjavÃ­k. In the mean time, in the name of staying on a schedule, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post this update.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mt.

This post focuses exclusively on my academic endeavors, aiming to capture the ways in which I attempted to better myself given that concisely summarizing the entirety of my experiences is an impossible task. I considered discussing the interesting technical knowledge I now have under my belt; not only does that conversation fail to provide a sensible close to this era of my life, but it can&amp;rsquo;t provide you, the reader, with anything worthwhile.
