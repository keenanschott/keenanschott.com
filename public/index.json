[{"categories":["Personal"],"contents":"New Year\u0026rsquo;s Day has come and gone, as has the time to be setting new goals and resolutions. This year, I intentionally let this day pass me by in an attempt to prove to myself that change can be done at any point in time, irrespective of some convenient window. Okay, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m lying just a little bit - I really did intend to get it together and hit the gym come January, but the easy excuse of having family still in town let me sink deeper into the couch as I let what will almost certainly be my last winter break as a student move on without much of anything being achieved. However, now that I\u0026rsquo;m back in school, I feel the drive to really set some goals and commit to them, hard.\nI could write extensively on the issues I have with hustle culture, the \u0026ldquo;grindset\u0026rdquo;, and, hell, even with the corny influencer-inspired self-improvement arcs I see much of my generation buying into it. I walked away from reading the now infamous Atomic Habits by James Clear a bit skeptical. Yes, getting one percent better everyday results in an easily grasped mathematical improvement. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not that simple. For myself, improvement is a non-linear process - some days, I achieve a two percent gain, on others, maybe a tenth of a percentage point gain, and, on all days, I keep up-to-date enough on my skills that even going an entire month without programming results in no regression. If you learn the skills right, it becomes more like riding a bike. My former classmate, Ethan Richards, wrote a great post on stressculture. In an attempt to grind my way into the next phase of life where I\u0026rsquo;m wildly successful and everything is so great and awesome (spoiler: there will always be stressors and it will never be perfect), I often forget to enjoy the here and now.\nSo, what does that have to do with goal setting? While I\u0026rsquo;ll keep the SMART details mostly to myself, I do want to share a brief overview of my goals and aspirations, as well as a reminder to keep things realistic. Will I have enough time to grind LeetCode 24/7 and break into FAANG? Probably not. Will I work my ass off to ensure I get a job in tech with the skills I\u0026rsquo;ve built over the last four year? No doubt. Will I get jacked? Probably not. Will I be able to run a half a marathon and get back to benching 225? With the right amount of dedication, yes. Here is a high-level overview of what I want to achieve in 2025:\nget a job as a software engineer or PM in tech, preferably in Seattle return to a basic level of physical fitness create a side project that demonstrates my skill set and the loosely defined ones:\nmake my mom happy write, write, write enjoy the present I aim to place heavy emphasis on the last one. In high school, I looked forward to the freedom of college. In college, I look forward to the job market. From here on out, I will be actively trying to remind myself that life is a blessing and everyone moment spent not enjoying it is a mistake. To maximize this enjoyment, we must do things that aren\u0026rsquo;t enjoyable, e.g., going to school or work, but, as time passes, I continually find myself aligning more and more with \u0026ldquo;work to live\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;live to work\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you find yourself relating to what I have to say, I encourage you to go easy on yourself. For the past year, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of time passively worrying about what the future holds. Will it all work out? Yes, it will. If I stick to a routine conducive to my success, I have nothing to worry about. Make time for friends. Make time for family. Go for a walk. Go to the movies alone. Go to a coffee shop alone and don\u0026rsquo;t look at your phone. Read a book outside. Avoid the garbage.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just on a tangent now. Anyway, I hope everyone has big aspirations for 2025, and I wish you all success. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry - WAGMI.\n","permalink":"https://www.keenanschott.com/posts/personal/goals-2025/","tags":["Goals","Career"],"title":"The Skeptic's Resolutions"},{"categories":["Music"],"contents":"In 2023, I embarked on a personal journey of listening to an album every single day. This endeavor expanded my musical horizons, but unfortunately, it went largely unchronicled and remains unshared with the world. Now, as a step toward sharing the music that shaped my year time around, I am excited to present ten albums that truly defined my 2024.\nPlease note that this list includes only albums released in the past year. Some honorable mentions are BRAT by Charli XCX, Fine Art by KNEECAP, Samurai by Lupe Fiasco, Alligator Bites Never Heal by Doechii, This is How Tomorrow Moves by beabadoobee, Bright Future by Adrianne Lenker, I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU by JPEGMAFIA, In Waves by Jamie xx, Two Star \u0026amp; The Dream Police by Mk.gee, and Cold Visions by Bladee, among others.\nThree\r#10\rFour Tet\rIn Three, Four Tet departs from his typical stadium setlists and navigates a far more intimate, restrained tone. An album built for getting lost in the soundscape and locking in; a far cry from his work with Skrillex and Fred again...\rSMILE! :D\r#9\rPorter Robinson\rA pairing of vivacious, energetic sound and a downcast, nostalgic mood, creating an album that pulls listeners between joy and melancholy. Although I still prefer Nurture and Worlds over SMILE! :D, the tour for this album was an incredible show and perhaps one of the best concert experiences I've had the fortune of seeing. GNX\r#8\rKendrick Lamar\rIt would be wrong to exclude the GOAT of West Coast hip-hop from this list. I spent this year exploring Kendrick's earlier work, such as Section.80, and I was impressed by how well it holds up and will continue to hold up twenty years from now. GNX is no different. The SZA features showcase his talent across genres. This album got mustard.\rSky Hundred\r#7\rParannoul\rI've been a fan of Parannoul since the release of To See the Next Part of the Dream, an album completed alone and in a bedroom. The vocals were recorded on a Samsung Galaxy S5. Sky Hundred continues this legacy of noisy, swelling shoegaze. I was overjoyed to see this release considering I was not a fan of the collaboration album earlier this year with Fax Gang.\rSubmarine\r#6\rThe Marías\rThe Marías' combination of psych, jazz, and dream-pop creates a melancholic album that, with the added context of the breakup between the couple that founded the band, resonates deeply with themes of love, loss, and introspection. It's hard to hate.\rCharm\r#5\rClairo\rBuilding on her signature dreamy indie-pop sound, Clairo continues to draw upon the '70s palette as she did in Sling, another fantastic album. It's interesting to read about her inspirations for this album, which include Harry Nilsson and The Beach Boys.\rThe New Sound\r#4\rGeordie Greep\rAs sad as I was to see the split of black midi, The New Sound does not disappoint. His unsubtle, unsympathetic characters paired with an unrelenting slurry of salsa, showtunes, jazz, and samba, among dozens of other styles, make for an album that some consider exhausting. If you can stomach the rollercoaster, it really is compelling.\rAAA\r#3\rHYUKOH, Sunset Rollercoaster\rHYUKOH and Sunset Rollercoaster join forces to create an album that's true to their beloved sounds, yet never cancels each other out. We get psych, bossa-nova, indie-pop, and more, with and the list going on and on for each track. And this is from two bands from different countries. Yet it's cohesive, and well-paced, with every instrument and voice adding depth and texture. Y is one of my favorite songs of the year.\rRomance\r#2\rFontaines D.C.\rOn their fourth album, the Irish group trades steely post-punk for stadium-sized alt rock. I've been enamored with the group since Skinty Fia, and although I expected a similar sound on Romance, I can't say I'm disappointed. I enjoy their newfounded amalgamation of Britpop and '90s alt rock. My favorite tracks include In the Modern World, Bug, and Favourite.\rImaginal Disk\r#1\rMagdalena Bay\rAs my introduction to Magdalena Bay, Imaginal Disk quickly became my favorite pop album of the year and served as a stellar first impression to the duo. The almost kitschy sci-fi theme working in tandem with candy floss melodies, as exemplified in Death \u0026 Romance, craft what would be mindless pop if done by any other artist. The album takes my favorite pieces from each of the band's primary inspirations: Grimes, Chairlift, and Charli XCX.\rI might look back on these rankings in a month\u0026rsquo;s time and wonder what I was thinking. Regardless, this is how it all fell into place for me right now, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s fascinating that, with the passing of time, we can look back on art and feel drastically different about it. Anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see what 2025 has to offer.\n","permalink":"https://www.keenanschott.com/posts/music/ten-albums-2024/","tags":["Ten Albums"],"title":"Ten Albums from 2024"},{"categories":["Travel"],"contents":"Now that I\u0026rsquo;m back in Washington for the foreseeable future, I\u0026rsquo;m excited to explore all that the state has to offer. This includes Mt. Rainier National Park, the United States\u0026rsquo; fourth national park and one of three in Washington. A friend and I decided to tackle one of the more popular trails in the park, the Skyline Loop. It\u0026rsquo;s 5.5 miles round trip and sees about a rise of 1,700 feet in elevation. The stairs on the climb up to the Skyline Trail have a quote inscribed into them from naturalist John Muir in 1889: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; the most luxuriant and the most extravagantly beautiful of all the alpine gardens I ever beheld in all my mountain-top wanderings.\u0026rdquo; I could see glimpses of what he meant, but, frankly, we did not go on a good day for pictures. It was very foggy, but it was still good to get our legs moving and some fresh air in our lungs.\nA Foggy DayShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nBeyond the incredible views, there was lots of active wildlife. The chipmunks in the park have no fear.

Little did I know, it would take more than thirty minutes. A black bear was meandering around the trail, and two park rangers were keeping visitors at a distance. Finally, they let us go but asked us to stick to one side to maintain our distance.\nWaiting PatientlyShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nThis was definitely not a comprehensive visit, and I look forward to returning in either the spring or summer (and hopefully actually seeing the mountain itself). A strong recommendation from me, especially given how easily accessible it is. I also hope to visit North Cascades National Park soon, arguably Washington\u0026rsquo;s most underrated national park.

We left on the final day of August on a direct flight from Seattle. Iceland is on Greenwich Mean Time, meaning an eight hour time difference that did not bode well with my inability to sleep on planes. After we landed at around ten in the morning on the first of September, we picked up our rental car and headed to Reykjavík. Thankfully, Iceland drives on the right side of the road, removing driving as one of the unpredictable variables that comes with travelling abroad. The biggest difference there was how narrow the roads were and kilometers per hour being the standard speed limit format. I would look down at the speedometer, see 100, and freak out for a second.\nSeattle to ReykjavíkShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nReykjavík On our first day in Reykjavík, we explored the city, visited the Harpa Concert Hall and Conference Center, and went on a food tour. The highlight of the tour was at Messinn, a seafood restaurant. This is an Icelandic cod with curry sauce, rucola salad, and potatoes. The other dish here was Plokkfiskur, a hearty fish and potato mash. Nearly every restaurant we visited only offered Icelandic beer, which I found interesting because while American soda brands, like Coca-Cola, are a universal language, Coors Light is not. The typical offerings were some variants of Gull, Víking, and Boli - all were pretty good!\nScranShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nAt another restaurant, Íslenski Barinn, we had the opportunity to try fermented shark. Although the smell was putrid, the taste was pretty neutral - I can see how, if driven by necessity, those who lived hundreds of years ago could live off this. We also had Brennivín, or burning wine. As the name implies, it burned as it went down the hatch. Another highlight of the food tour was trying Iceland\u0026rsquo;s unofficial national dish, the hotdog, which had ketchup, mustard, remoulade sauce, deep fried onion, and raw onion. It was good, but a little overwhelming. Sometimes, plain old ketchup and mustard will do the trick.\nFermented SharkShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nFollowing our tour, we were dropped in front of Hallgrímskirkja, the largest church in Iceland and among the tallest structures in the country. Its designed to resemble the trap rocks, mountains, and glaciers of Iceland\u0026rsquo;s landscape. As we\u0026rsquo;ll see later, the design does a pretty good job.\nHallgrímskirkjaShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nIn front of Hallgrímskirkja sits the statue of Norse explorer Leif Erikson, commissioned by the United States.

If anything, us Americans can respect democracy.\nLeif EriksonShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nSnæfellsnes Next, we headed north to Snæfellsnes, a large peninsula in western Iceland. We stopped at Ytri Tunga, a beach by a farm of the same name. Unlike many of the beaches in Iceland, Ytri Tunga has golden sand rather than black. The big draw here was the seals, as it\u0026rsquo;s said to be one of the most reliable sites in Iceland to see them.\nCheesin'Shot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS60.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nLoungin\u0026rsquo; AroundShot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS60.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nStretchin'Shot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS60.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nMessin\u0026rsquo; AroundShot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS60.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nThe sheep in Iceland are abundant; not a day passed without seeing at least hundreds of sheep.

Given that we were visiting in early September, we were witnessing the end of the cap\u0026rsquo;s recession, meaning the ice was covered almost entirely in volcanic ash, which would soon be buried as the ice grew once more in the winter.

The first photo depicts a statue of Ingólfr Arnarson, the first permanent Norse settler of Iceland in 874. Only the Irish monks had been in the country before the Norsemen, but left due to not wanting to live with pagans. Next up is Christian IX, the King of Denmark in the late 1860s. The statue depicts him handing over Iceland\u0026rsquo;s first constitution in 1874. With Iceland under the rule of the Kingdom of Denmark at the time, this act was the first step in what would eventually lead to Iceland\u0026rsquo;s independence.\nIngólfr ArnarsonShot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS60.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nChristian IX of DenmarkShot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS60.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nI also took a few moments to photograph the streets of Reykjavík.

I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m only now finding my bearings since my previous post about Mount Lincoln - I have since moved from home to Edmonds to (at some point in the near future) Seattle, visited two national parks, and ventured out of North America for the first time to see the sights in Iceland. As soon as I have the opportunity to organize all my photos, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to expand on this post and create future posts on Mount Rainier and the scenes around Reykjavík. In the mean time, in the name of staying on a schedule, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d post this update.\nMy father and I stopped by Arches National Park for a few days on our way home from Colorado in August. The following photos are some of the highlights that I managed to capture when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t struggling in the scorching temperatures. It was an amazing stop to not only enjoy some incredible scenes, but to give greater purpose to what would have otherwise been a monotonous journey. Unlike my last post on Mt.

Colorado has 53 14ers, California has 12, and Washington has 2 (Mount Rainier is definitely on the to-do list). I was approaching the end of my time in Colorado this summer and had yet to hike a 14er, so a buddy of mine and I decided to tackle Mount Lincoln, the 37th highest peak in North America.\nWe started our day early, around four in the morning. The tone was set when we were passing through Frisco and I was pulled over for speeding. When no one else is on the road in a mountain town, it can be difficult to reference your speed against other vehicles, and I guess my absent-mindedness got the better of me. Regardless, one $165 parking ticket later, we were back on the road. We arrived at the Kite Lake Trailhead and began our trek to the summit. Now, I consider myself to be in decent shape, but it became evident from the get-go that I would need to reconsider that assumption. I took breaks often just to catch my breath; the elevation proved to be the biggest challenge throughout.\nA few miles removed from Kite LakeShot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX07.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nThe first portion of our hike up was beautiful. Waterfalls and wildflowers surrounded us, but I was most infatuated with the pikas weaving in and out of the nearby boulders. After reaching the junction between the trails leading to the summits of Mt. Democrat and Mt. Lincoln, we took a longer break to soak in the views and eat some trail mix.\nMt. DemocratShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nThe hardest stretch of trail was undeniably between this junction and the summit of Mt. Cameron, whose parent peak is Mt. Lincoln. It felt a lot more vertical than it likely was, and our breaks became more frequent. It was obvious we were behind the typical pace; we saw a lot of groups descending as we were making our way to the summit. A group of CU students asked me to take their photo at the top, and we borrowed their cardboard sign to commemorate our journey as well.\nMt. CameronShot on the iPhone 12.\rCredit:\rKeenan Schott\nThe hike from Mt. Cameron to Mt. Lincoln was fairly easy, especially compared to the portion we had just completed. At the summit of Mt. Lincoln, there were several markers and cairns. Mt. Lincoln is named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, 16th president of the United States and an early member of the Republican party. I thought about how he\u0026rsquo;d probably be happy that Mt. Lincoln is around 100 feet taller than the neighboring Mt. Democrat.\nUSGS marker at Mt.

Democrat while we were lounging on the summit. Considering I had to poop when we began our hike, I vetoed any notion of the possibility. Thus, we began our descent, which was much quicker than the way up. It was around eleven by the time we reached the car, and we stopped in Breckenridge for lunch on the way back. Colorado\u0026rsquo;s mountain towns have a charm that is difficult to replicate. Thankfully, there were no more traffic tickets in my future. I would highly suggest summiting a 14er to hikers of all skill levels - it\u0026rsquo;s a fun challenge that not only allows you to explore Colorado, but to develop an appreciation for the beauty of the Rockies.\n","permalink":"https://www.keenanschott.com/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/","tags":["Colorado","Fourteeners","Hiking"],"title":"Mt. Lincoln"},{"categories":["Education"],"contents":"After just over two months since graduating from the Colorado School of Mines, I find myself reflecting on my time in Golden. This post focuses exclusively on my academic endeavors, aiming to capture the ways in which I attempted to better myself given that concisely summarizing the entirety of my experiences is an impossible task. I considered discussing the interesting technical knowledge I now have under my belt; not only does that conversation fail to provide a sensible close to this era of my life, but it can\u0026rsquo;t provide you, the reader, with anything worthwhile. Rather, I wish to speak about one class I took at Mines in particular and why I consider it my favorite.\nAs a computer science student (well, as a now former computer science student), it may be surprising to discover that my favorite class I had taken at Mines was Linear Algebra. I find it important to note that although the intersection between computer science and mathematics is large, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re more into the theoretical and mathematical aspects of CS than the software engineering aspect, there are still distinctions in how these subjects are taught. I found that even in my CS courses grounded in gaining a deeper understanding of how the code you\u0026rsquo;re writing interfaces with hardware where the freedom of choice in your approach or design may be stifled, such as Embedded Systems, creativity was seemingly always present. When you sit down and write code, even in low-level languages, there are always a million right ways to the answer.\nFor example, a simple, straightforward approach.\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { printf(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;); return 0; } On the other hand, an elaborate, roundabout approach.\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;math.h\u0026gt; int main() { float coefficients[] = {72.0, 50.5, 36.0, 27.0, 22.2, 7.3, 4.6, 10.9, 12.3, 11.4, 9.8, 8.3, 2.5}; for (int i = 1; i \u0026lt; 14; i++) { printf(\u0026#34;%c\u0026#34;, (char)round(i * coefficients[i - 1])); } return 0; } Anyway, my view of mathematics has always been one-dimensional. I learn of a problem and the method(s) of figuring out the answer to said problem, and I wash my hands of it. The creativity found in programming felt absent in math. I\u0026rsquo;ve always found it to be interesting - there are moments when my curiosity leads me down a rabbit hole, but I find the technical jargon and its non-concrete nature to be overwhelming. Linear Algebra seemed no different; on the first day of class, I prepared myself to understand the bare minimum about determinants and eigenvalues, and, for a while, my expectations were spot on. I put in quite a bit of effort, but as soon as I wrapped my head around a given topic, I moved on. I actually became frustrated due to how hand-wavy the entire subject seemed at first, but that quickly changed.\nI always seem to understand the applications of a given subject months after I finish a course on it. Linear Algebra with Dr. Mikucki was different - it felt like my first college course driven by an understanding of its application in a multitude of fields. Dr. Mikucki started his lecture one day with an introduction to singular value decomposition and how it can be applied in image compression. I\u0026rsquo;ll spare you most of the technical details, but this started my deep dive into understanding lossy and lossless compression. Although a more sophisticated method like JPG generally outperforms compression using SVD, I was enamored with the idea of using something I just learned in a programming context.\nI went hands-on. I spent the subsequent weekend working on creating my own functioning SVD image compression program; you can find the script and an in-depth technical explanation on GitHub. Dr. Mikucki was kind enough to discuss the topic with me on several occasions and point me in the right direction for further investigation. This was my inflection point in the course. All of a sudden, I found myself invested in the course in a way I hadn\u0026rsquo;t experienced before - I was doing investigations into the applications of linear algebra on my own time. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I typically find most to all of my coursework to be decently interesting, but I do find myself browsing random Wikipedia pages when lecture fails to provide anything that I can\u0026rsquo;t already get from a book.\nI spent most of my formative years believing that fun was supposed to happen outside of school and work, and these were just things we had to do. It\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate that many adults hold this mindset, but if I were stuck in a cubicle updating thousands of lines of code to combat Y2K, I might also revert to this way of thinking. Especially in a STEM education, where the fantastical technical details of industry seem a million miles away, it can feel like you\u0026rsquo;re just learning for the sake of learning. For example, it\u0026rsquo;s cool that I know about orbital shells and Galois fields, but how am I going to use this knowledge as a software engineer? Linear Algebra presented the applications first, and I found that to be a convincing method of commanding my attention for the better part of the semester.\nInstead of viewing the trudge to my classes as an obligation or a box to check, I found myself having fun, and this was informative for many courses to come afterwards. From there on out, I sought out knowledge I found most interesting and used that as the guiding principle for all of my courses. Of course, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t always succeed; some topics were just cut out to be boring, but it definitively shifted my perspective on learning and what I want out of my career. Learning never stops. If I\u0026rsquo;m employed in a job where my brain is static, doing the same task over and over again just because I know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, something\u0026rsquo;s wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s a joy and a privilege to pursue knowledge, and it\u0026rsquo;s fun! Linear Algebra, my favorite course at Mines, made that idea clear to me, and that\u0026rsquo;s more valuable than anything I can remember from Chemistry I.\n","permalink":"https://www.keenanschott.com/posts/education/colorado-school-of-mines/","tags":["Colorado","Mines","Computer Science","Math"],"title":"Colorado School of Mines"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello, and welcome to my website!\nMy name is Keenan, and I\u0026rsquo;m a recent Colorado School of Mines alum (B.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Computer Engineering, 2024) living in Edmonds, Washington.

In these contexts, speakers use a wide range of\rreferring gestures beyond those used in the small-scale interaction contexts\rthat HRI research typically investigates.\rIn this work, we thus seek to understand how robots can better generate\rgestures to accompany their referring language in large-scale interaction\rcontexts. In service of this goal, we present the results of two\rhuman-subject studies: (1) a human-human study exploring how human gestures\rchange in large-scale interaction contexts, and to identify human-like gestures\rsuitable to such contexts yet readily implemented on robot hardware; and (2) a\rhuman-robot study conducted in a tightly controlled Virtual Reality environment,\rto evaluate robots' use of those identified gestures.\rOur results show that robot use of Precise Deictic and Abstract Pointing\rgestures afford different types of benefits when used to refer to visible vs.\rnon-visible referents, leading us to formulate three concrete design guidelines.\rThese results highlight both the opportunities for robot use of more humanlike\rgestures in large-scale interaction contexts, as well as the need for future\rwork exploring their use as part of multi-modal communication.\rAs a research assistant, I aided in leading the human-robot study and analyzing\rthe results.
