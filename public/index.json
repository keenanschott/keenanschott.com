Teaching Assistant\r\u0026para;\rDecember 2021 - December 2023\rColorado School of Mines\nI have been fortunate to serve as a teaching assistant for multiple iterations of\rthe introductory computer science course at my alma mater, Colorado School of Mines.\rI have been a TA for the following courses:\rIntroduction to Computer Science Lab (CSCI 102) in Spring 2022, Fall 2022, and Spring 2023.\rI became a TA for CSCI 102 while I was still a first-year student, directly after taking the\rcourse myself. In this role, I worked under Eric Roels and Dr. Rob Thompson.\rTopics that the class covered: Python programming, which included data types, functions, recursion,\retc., the translation between word problems, algorithms, and high-level computer programs,\rdebugging, synthesis of documentation and online resources, and complex program design.\rComputer Science for STEM (CSCI 128) in Fall 2023.\rI served on the team that transitioned CSCI 102 to CSCI 128, which places a greater emphasis on\rthe broader impact of computer science on society and a variety of other STEM fields. In this\rrole, I worked under Mete Saka.\rTopics that the class covers: Python basics, algorithms, data representation, conditionals and\rboolean logic, scientific computing best practices, loops, complex logic, files, data science,\rsocial concerns, functions, and classes and objects.\rEducation\r\u0026para;\rM.S. in Information Management\r\u0026para;\rSeptember 2024 - August 2025\rUniversity of Washington\rI will graduate with a degree in Information Management and a specialization in\rProgram/Product Management \u0026 Consulting (PPMC).

I was placed on the\rDean's List all six semesters I attended. I was awarded the\rC-MAPP Scholarship\rboth years I was eligible from\rtheTradeDesk and\rDatava and the\rCyber Defense Education Certificate\rauthorized by the\rNSA and\rDHS for the completion of select\rcourses.\rAs a student, I often participated in the Mines ACM Student Chapter. In my first\ryear, I served as the Administrative Chair of the Spruce Community Council\rthrough the Mines Residence Hall Association Chapter\r(RHA).\rIn my second year, I served as the Director of Business \u0026 Administration of the\rRHA.\rNotable classes I took include...\rAlgorithms\rOperating Systems\rPrinciples of Programming Languages\rEmbedded Systems\rCryptography\rComputer Networks\rDatabase Management\rLinear Algebra\rDiscrete Mathematics\rSoftware Engineering and Advanced Software Engineering (Field Session)\rComputer Organization\rLinux\rDigital Logic\rElectrical Circuits\rData Structures\rProgramming Concepts\rTransfer Credit\r\u0026para;\rSeptember 2019 - September 2022\rThrough high school and college, I took classes at a variety of community colleges and\runiversities.

In these contexts, speakers use a wide range of\rreferring gestures beyond those used in the small-scale interaction contexts\rthat HRI research typically investigates.\rIn this work, we thus seek to understand how robots can better generate\rgestures to accompany their referring language in large-scale interaction\rcontexts. In service of this goal, we present the results of two\rhuman-subject studies: (1) a human-human study exploring how human gestures\rchange in large-scale interaction contexts, and to identify human-like gestures\rsuitable to such contexts yet readily implemented on robot hardware; and (2) a\rhuman-robot study conducted in a tightly controlled Virtual Reality environment,\rto evaluate robots' use of those identified gestures. Our results show that robot use of Precise Deictic and Abstract Pointing\rgestures afford different types of benefits when used to refer to visible vs.\rnon-visible referents, leading us to formulate three concrete design guidelines.\rThese results highlight both the opportunities for robot use of more humanlike\rgestures in large-scale interaction contexts, as well as the need for future\rwork exploring their use as part of multi-modal communication.\rAs a research assistant, I aided in leading the human-robot study and analyzing\rthe results. I utilized\rR\rto draw conclusions from experimental data, and our\rwork was presented by my colleague, Annie Huang, at the 2024 ACM/IEEE\rInternational Conference on Human-Robot Interaction\r(HRI 2024)\rin Boulder, Colorado.\rProjects\r\u0026para;\rCS Curriculum Flowchart\r\u0026para;\rJuly 2023 - August 2023\r\u0026nbsp;GitHub\rThe CS Curriculum Flowchart was designed as a visually engaging alternative to dull, static,\runiversity-provided flowcharts. This was a personal project created to give me an introduction\rto full-stack development - I managed to learn JavaScript, React, and REST API design at a\rsurface level. Keyboardless Gaming\r\u0026para;\rJuly 2023\r\u0026nbsp;GitHub\rA few small Python scripts designed to allow the user to play virtually any game without a\rkeyboard. This was a fun project built over a week that not only gave me experience using\rthreads but provided hours of entertainment and could also be used in accessibility contexts. Arbitrage Calculator\r\u0026para;\rMay 2023 - June 2023\r\u0026nbsp;GitHub\rThe Arbitrage Calculator was built utilzing a real-time sports betting API to strategically\ridentify arbitrage opportunities within online markets. This was a personal project designed\rto give me an introduction to PHP and API usage; it was also an interesting opportunity to\rresearch arbitrage\rbetting.\rClue\r\u0026para;\rJanuary 2023 - June 2023\r\u0026nbsp;GitHub\rClue was a reimagining of the\rclassic game\rbuilt over the duration of the\rCSCI 306\rcourse. This project was a great introduction to building larger, cohesive pieces of\rsoftware; I utilized unit testing and employed advanced object-oriented programming\r(OOP) techniques in Java.\rSingular Value Decomposition Image Compression\r\u0026para;\rApril 2023\r\u0026nbsp;GitHub\rSingular Value Decomposition Image Compression was designed as an investigation into a concept\rI had recently learned about in my linear algebra class. I utilized Python to display the\roriginal image, the compressed image, the compression ratio, and the conserved data.\rPresentations\r\u0026para;\rCryptographic Techniques for Transparent and Efficient Markets\r\u0026para;\rMay 2024\r\u0026nbsp;PDF\rI gave a presentation on this paper at the end of CSCI 474 (Introduction to\rCryptography) on the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) in financial markets to strengthen the balance\rbetween market integrity and market transparency.\r","permalink":"https://www.keenanschott.com/portfolio/","tags":null,"title":"Portfolio"}]
