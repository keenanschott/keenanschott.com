Colorado has 53 14ers, California has 12, and Washington has 2 (<a href=https://keenanschott.com/posts/travel/mount-rainier/ rel=external target=_blank>Mount Rainier<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> is definitely on the to-do list). I was approaching the end of my time in Colorado this summer and had yet to hike a 14er, so a buddy of mine and I decided to tackle <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lincoln_%28Colorado%29 rel=external target=_blank>Mount Lincoln<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, the 37th highest peak in North America.</p><p>We started our day early, around four in the morning. The tone was set when we were passing through Frisco and I was pulled over for speeding. When no one else is on the road in a mountain town, it can be difficult to reference your speed against other vehicles, and I guess my absent-mindedness got the better of me. Regardless, one $165 parking ticket later, we were back on the road. We arrived at the <a href="https://www.14ers.com/php14ers/trailheadsview.php?thparm=mr01" rel=external target=_blank>Kite Lake Trailhead<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and began our trek to the summit. Now, I consider myself to be in decent shape, but it became evident from the get-go that I would need to reconsider that assumption. I took breaks often just to catch my breath; the elevation proved to be the biggest challenge throughout.</p><figure><a href=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/trailhead_hu_5c103b69fb8de46b.webp target=_blank><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/trailhead_hu_81377cb382f4c1b1.webp 200w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/trailhead_hu_6545503bf53aa987.webp 400w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/trailhead_hu_4bea7930fa0214e5.webp 600w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/trailhead_hu_3ee71c889f53ce9.webp 800w"><img src=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/trailhead_hu_2862ba42f824e1e7.webp alt="Shot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX07." loading=lazy></picture></a><figcaption><h4>A few miles removed from Kite Lake</h4><p>Shot on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX07.

Waterfalls and wildflowers surrounded us, but I was most infatuated with the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika rel=external target=_blank>pikas<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> weaving in and out of the nearby boulders. After reaching the junction between the trails leading to the summits of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Democrat rel=external target=_blank>Mt. Democrat<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and Mt. Lincoln, we took a longer break to soak in the views and eat some trail mix.</p><figure><a href=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_democrat_hu_b986fa38ede52b5.webp target=_blank><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_democrat_hu_e90212c3d9da0b26.webp 200w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_democrat_hu_195c9640a1349a0d.webp 400w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_democrat_hu_2b1203e9f86671dd.webp 600w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_democrat_hu_f5147ddb79a61574.webp 800w"><img src=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_democrat_hu_bcff435dc848c45c.webp alt="Shot on the iPhone 12." loading=lazy></picture></a><figcaption><h4>Mt.

Cameron<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, whose parent peak is Mt. Lincoln. It felt a lot more vertical than it likely was, and our breaks became more frequent. It was obvious we were behind the typical pace; we saw a lot of groups descending as we were making our way to the summit. A group of CU students asked me to take their photo at the top, and we borrowed their cardboard sign to commemorate our journey as well.</p><figure><a href=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_cameron_hu_a5d06e95a3854cc5.webp target=_blank><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_cameron_hu_ccd662535f3fd840.webp 200w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_cameron_hu_97febc75efb9acaf.webp 400w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_cameron_hu_5e20b94612376c00.webp 600w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_cameron_hu_553c664d4355db9b.webp 800w"><img src=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_cameron_hu_85389811bbfd7bdb.webp alt="Shot on the iPhone 12." loading=lazy></picture></a><figcaption><h4>Mt.

<a href=https://keenanschott.com target=_blank>Keenan Schott</a></i></p></figcaption></figure><p>The hike from Mt. Cameron to Mt. Lincoln was fairly easy, especially compared to the portion we had just completed. At the summit of Mt. Lincoln, there were several markers and cairns. Mt. Lincoln is named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, 16th president of the United States and an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29#19th_century rel=external target=_blank>early member of the Republican party<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. I thought about how he&rsquo;d probably be happy that Mt. Lincoln is around 100 feet taller than the neighboring Mt. Democrat.</p><figure><a href=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_lincoln_hu_5cc2e4b8e154d810.webp target=_blank><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_lincoln_hu_11ef50b455596eb8.webp 200w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_lincoln_hu_377e148165436c6d.webp 400w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_lincoln_hu_747839c431e46974.webp 600w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_lincoln_hu_ba8374d94ad94bc3.webp 800w"><img src=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/mount_lincoln_hu_7c6915b1ed5216d6.webp alt="Shot on the iPhone 12." loading=lazy></picture></a><figcaption><h4>USGS marker at Mt.

It was the type of slide you can only ride once.</p><figure><a href=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/death_slide_hu_aacb036b82488183.webp target=_blank><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/death_slide_hu_d2e7ba020b8bd721.webp 200w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/death_slide_hu_d221eeb4c82f90a3.webp 400w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/death_slide_hu_7ec98c800beee184.webp 600w, /posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/death_slide_hu_a5b9dfb04704ea43.webp 800w"><img src=/posts/travel/mount-lincoln/images/death_slide_hu_b3b5229eef2d596b.webp alt="Shot on the iPhone 12." loading=lazy></picture></a><figcaption><h4>The death slide at Mt.

Considering I had to poop when we began our hike, I vetoed any notion of the possibility. Thus, we began our descent, which was much quicker than the way up. It was around eleven by the time we reached the car, and we stopped in Breckenridge for lunch on the way back. Colorado&rsquo;s mountain towns have a charm that is difficult to replicate. Thankfully, there were no more traffic tickets in my future. I would highly suggest summiting a 14er to hikers of all skill levels - it&rsquo;s a fun challenge that not only allows you to explore Colorado, but to develop an appreciation for the beauty of the Rockies.</p></div></article></main><div class=next-prev><a class=prev href=https://www.keenanschott.com/posts/education/colorado-school-of-mines/ title="Colorado School of Mines">« Colorado School of Mines</a>
