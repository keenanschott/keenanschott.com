Colorado has 53 14ers, California has 12, and Washington has 2 (Mount Rainier is definitely on the to-do list). I was approaching the end of my time in Colorado this summer and had yet to hike a 14er, so a buddy of mine and I decided to tackle Mount Lincoln, the 37th highest peak in North America.
We started our day early, around four in the morning. The tone was set when we were passing through Frisco and I was pulled over for speeding.</description></item></channel></rss>
