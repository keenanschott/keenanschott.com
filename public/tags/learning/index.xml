While there will be a future post dedicated solely to my personal growth and favorite moments during my three years in Colorado, that moment will likely coincide with my departure in August. This post focuses exclusively on my academic endeavors, aiming to capture the ways in which I attempted to better myself. To concisely summarize the entirety of my experiences is an impossible task. I considered discussing the interesting technical knowledge I now have under my belt; not only does that conversation fail to provide a sensible close to this era of my life, but it can&amp;rsquo;t provide you, the reader, with anything worthwhile.</description></item></channel></rss>
