We left on the final day of August on a direct flight from Seattle. Iceland is on Greenwich Mean Time, meaning an eight hour time difference that did not bode well with someone that cannot sleep on planes. After we landed at around ten in the morning on the first of September, we picked up our rental car and headed to ReykjavÃ­k. Thankfully, Iceland drives on the right side of the road, removing driving as an unpredictable variable. The biggest difference there was how narrow the roads were and kilometers per hour being the standard speed limit format. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how my brain could look down at the speedometer, see 100 kph, and freak out for a second.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
